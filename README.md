#### Planning, Process & Problem Solving:

The team met together to discuss our project and broke it down into the major elements.  We the examined those elements to break them down into small tasks.  We created a Trello tracking board for these small tasks which were coded by color labels according to the major element they applied to.  We decided that our sprints would be every half day so  day one started with sprint planning and a quick stand up and we wrapped at lunchtime with a srpint retrospective where we discussed what worked well and what could be improved about our processes.


After lunch we did another stand up and our second sprint planning to determie what tickets were still in progress and what was next in the queue to complete in order to achieve MVP.  Any problems encountered were first researched by the developer facing it, and then discussed among the group as an escalation. If we weren’t able to solve the issue via quorum, it went to the issue queue.
Problems in process or with the group were otherwise highlighted in the sprints retrospective and addressed by the scrum master.
